# Introduction

The by-product of all-grain brewing, spent grain, is still valuable and has many uses. The easiest way I have found thus far to take advantage of this by-product, and make my hard earned cash stretch further, is to make dog biscuits. 

The recipe on this page is tried and true, and we have yet to find a dog that does not enjoy them! You will also become very popular around the office if you hand bags of these out to your co-workers!

# Equipment and Supplies
On brew day, we tend to have a "dog biscuit station" set up in the kitchen with the equipment set up and ingredients laid out, so that during the boil of the brew, we can mix up the dog biscuit dough to be chilled. We usually bake one dough ball up the day of the brew, and the rest we bake over the next couple of days.

## Equipment
* [Stand Mixer]({{<affiliate-links "stand mixer">}}) with flat beater
* 2 metal baking sheets
* pizza cutter
* rolling pin
* parchment paper
* plastic wrap


## Ingredients
* 4 cups spent grain
* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 eggs
* 1/4 cup natural peanut butter

# Making the Dough
{{< foldergallery src="img/guides/2-brew_dog_biscuits/making-the-dough" >}}

1. Combine all ingredients in your mixer bowl, and mix on a low setting till blended
2. Place two large pieces of plastic wrap on your table (large enough to wrap a dough ball)
3. Split the dough mixture into two equal portions on the plastic wraps, and wrap them up.
4. Place the dough balls in your fridge and let them chill at least one hour before baking. I usually start baking them up the next day.

# Baking the Biscuits
{{< foldergallery src="img/guides/2-brew_dog_biscuits/baking" >}}

1. Preheat oven to 350&deg;F
2. Cut off two pieces of parchment paper, big enough so that a single piece will cover an entire baking sheet.
3. Take a single chilled dough ball out of the fridge, and split it equally among the two sheets of parchment papers.
4. Using the plastic sheet that was covering the dough ball and your rolling pin, you can roll out the dough between the plastic sheet and the parchment paper to as thin as you can make it (around 1/8 inch). Lift the plastic sheet off, and use it on the other dough portion to do the same. Discard the plastic sheet when you are done this step.
5. Place each parchment/dough sheet onto the baking sheets, and place in the oven. I have had no problem having the shelves in my oven close together in the center of the oven, and baking both sheets up at the same time.
6. Bake for 30 minutes
7. Remove sheets from oven, and use the pizza slicer to cut the cookies into strips (anywhere from 1-2 inches wide, your dog won't care)
8. Put the sheets back into the oven and reduce the heat to 225&deg;F and bake for another 2-3 hours. Depending on how thick your cookie sheets are, will determine how long it will need to completely dry out. It is important to dry out these cookies so that they last a nice long time.

# Share the Love

A single batch of this recipe is enough to fill two brown paper lunch bags. One bag is more than enough to treat my dog till I brew again, so I tend to give out many of these bags to friends and co-workers, since I make up many batches of biscuits per brew.
