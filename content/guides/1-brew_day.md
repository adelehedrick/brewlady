# Introduction

{{< tooltip "All-grain brewing">}}{{< glossary "all-grain brewing">}}{{< /tooltip >}} seems intimidating, but actually isn't as complex as one would think. Personally, I struggle with extract and never seem to get it all out of the container, so {{< tooltip "all-grain brewing">}}{{< glossary "all-grain brewing">}}{{< /tooltip >}} agrees with me. The only additional equipment you need to go from {{< tooltip "extract brewing">}}{{< glossary "extract brewing">}}{{< /tooltip >}} to {{< tooltip "all-grain brewing">}}{{< glossary "all-grain brewing">}}{{< /tooltip >}} is a {{< tooltip "mash tun">}}{{< glossary "mash tun">}}{{< /tooltip >}}! I recommend reading through this entire guide before you start your brew day!

# Equipment and Supplies
Arrange all of your equipment and supplies in the area you will be brewing in. Best to clean all the surfaces before laying everything out.

## Equipment
* [Mash Tun]({{<affiliate-links "tank tun">}})
* 1/2 inch clear tubing
* [Stainless steel barbed hose fitting]({{<affiliate-links "barbed hose fitting">}}) (this came with my mash tun)
* [Brew kettle](https://www.thehomebrewbeeracademy.ca/products/8-gallon-heavy-duty-ss-201-kettle?_pos=9&_sid=9f74a9e98&_ss=r) (I use an 8 gal kettle with thermometer and ball valve)
* Second kettle, or a giant soup pot (to heat sparge water)
* Thermometer for sparge water
* Hose that fits into the barbed fitting that came with the mash tun

## Consumable Products
* Milled grains
* Hops
* Whirlfloc tablet

# Brew Day Cleaning
You must ensure that all of your equipment is clean and free of debris. I use [PBW](({{<affiliate-links "pbw">}})) to clean all of my equipment, and usually let it sit in the cleaning solution overnight the night before and rinse it all the day of brewing.

Once the wort is happily situated in the {{< tooltip "fermentor">}}{{< glossary "fermentor">}}{{< /tooltip >}}, I clean everything immediately. The longer you let things sit, the harder it will be to clean. Again I use [PBW](({{<affiliate-links "pbw">}})) for cleaning post brew.

# Read Your Recipe and Make Your Plan
To have a successful brew day, there is some information that you will need to identify in your recipe that only your recipe can tell you, and I strongly recommend finding this information and having it ready before you need it. The pieces of information you need to identify are:

* Target mash temperature
* Strike water temperature (can be calculated from target mash temperature)
* Initial mash water volume (typically 1.5-2 quart of water to pound of grain)
* Initial mash duration (usually around 60 minutes)
* Sparge water temperature
* Amount of wort to collect from the mash (for a 5 gallon recipe this can be anywhere from 5.5 to 7 gallons)
* Boil and hop addition schedule
* Primary fermentation temperature range
* Secondary fermentation temperature range (optional)

# The Mash
Essentially you are going to heat water and then steep your grains in it!

1. Using your brew kettle, heat your initial mash water to your strike water temperature, and heat some tap water in a *tea kettle*
2. When your initial mash water almost reaches your strike water temperature, pour all of the water from your *tea kettle* into your mash tun to pre-heat it. I typically close up the mash tun and give it a swirl
3. When your initial mash water is about 2-3 degrees away from your strike water temperature, drain out the water used to pre-heat your mash tun
4. Add your grains to the mash tun
5. Hook up a hose to your brew kettle 
6. When your initial mash water actually reaches your strike water temperature, add it all to your mash tun, give it a stir with a big spoon, and set a timer for the initial mash duration, you now have an empty brew kettle
7. Remove the hose from the empty brew kettle and attach it to the mash tun
8. In a secondary kettle, or in my case, the largest soup pot in my kitchen, I start heating more spring water aiming to heat it to the desired sparge water temperature
9. When your initial mash timer ends, slowly drain the liquid out of your mash tun and into your brew kettle. By slowly draining the liquid out, you are more likely to compact the grain around the mesh/filter inside your tun which results in less grain husk from entering your kettle.
10. When the liquid stops running, add your heated sparge water to the mash tun, give it a stir and based upon how much initial wort you collected, you may want to let the sparge water sit in the mash tun while you heat more sparge water. Keep adding to and draining from the mash tun until you achieve the desired amount of wort in your brew kettle.

You now have the beginnings of your wort!

# The Boil
This is the most complex part of the process, and timing is everything. You will need to add your hops at specific times during your boil, and be on stand by to stir the pot every time you add hops because for whatever reason, that's when you are most likely to experience boil over. You will want to add your wort chiller to the kettle somewhere around 15-20 minutes before the end of the boil. Adding your wort chiller with 15+ minutes left to the boil, will sanitize the wort chiller.

1. Heat brew kettle to bring the wort to a gentle boil
2. Crush your whirlfloc tablet (if you have one) and set aside in a bowl
3. Follow your brew schedule, it may look something like this:
	1. Add bittering hops and boil for 45 minutes, then proceed to next step
	2. Add aroma hops, crushed whirlfloc tablet, wort chiller to the kettle, and boil for 15 minutes, then proceed to next step
	3. End boil 
4. When you finish your brew schedule, turn on the facet attached to your wort chiller to cool the wort to within the primary fermentation range. If you aren't using a wort chiller, you can move the kettle into your sink and surround it with ice and water. The faster you cool the wort the better!

# Transfer to Your Fermentor
This is the very delicate time when attention to detail is key. Nothing, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, can touch your wort unless it has been sterilized!

1. Spray StarSan through the hose then connect it to your brew kettle. Some will argue that you have ran hot water already through it, but do you really want to risk something having gotten into the hose when you weren't using it?
2. Heavily spray StarSan in your fermentor, the lid of your fermentor, rubber stopper, any o-rings that are a part of your fermentor, thief, hydrometer, and the airlock pieces. Make sure the surfaces have been thoroughly coated. Position the fermentor and pieces in such a way that excess StarSan can drain off. *Do not rinse the StarSan from anything.* StarSan is a no-rinse sanitizer and is safe for eating and will not affect the taste of your beer. 
3. Let the equipment sit for at least 1 minute, then attach the fermentor lid to your fermentor
4. Open the ball-valve on the kettle and drain into the fermentor, all while shaking the hose in the fermentor to aerate the wort and get as much oxygen into the wort as possible. Some people use a well sanitized air stone to aerate the wort, but I've done well enough without it.
5. Use your thief to collect some of the wort, drop the hydrometer into the thief and record your original gravity reading.
5. Add your stopper to the fermentor. Make it good and tight!
6. Fill your airlock with spring water to the fill line
7. Attach your airlock to the fermentor. Make sure it is snug.
8. Move your fermentor to a cool dark place

# Clean Everything
Do not delay in cleaning. The second the crud dries to your kettle, it becomes harder to remove. I typically have all my tools soaking in a [PBW](({{<affiliate-links "pbw">}})) filled kettle over night, and then rinse the next day. The mash tun I thoroughly rinse with the garden hose. I don't waste any PBW on my mash tun since the wort that I collect from it gets boiled for at least an hour. I do inspect my mash tun prior to using it and determine if I do need to give it a PBW wash at that point.

# Post Brew Day
Check on your fermentor the next day to see if the airlock has any activity, if it doesn't, check the next day. A couple days before fermentation is due to be complete (refer to your recipe for estimated fermentation time), open up the fermentor and using a well sanitized theif and hydrometer, record a gravity reading. If your reading is close to your desired final gravity, then you may want to bottle your beer sooner rather than later. If your still far away from your desired final gravity, then take another reading in a couple days. When your gravity readings show now change from one day to another, then fermentation is likely as complete as it is going to get, and you should proceed to bottling.

# Cheers!
Hope you enjoyed this guide and have a successful brew!
