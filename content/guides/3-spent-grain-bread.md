# Introduction

After many trials and experiments, I've finally crafted a recipe for fresh spent grain bread using a bread machine! Once you finish your sparge, you can get a loaf started in your machine before your wort has even hit its boiling point, and within a couple of hours, you will be enjoying some delicious bread!

This bread is by far a favourite in my household as well as every household that has been gifted a loaf. My children have named it "soft bread", and so I try to stock up my freezer with as much as I can stand to make!
