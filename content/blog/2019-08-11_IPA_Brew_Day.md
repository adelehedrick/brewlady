# Brew Day Journal

## The Mash




## The Boil



### Adding the Bittering Hops



### Adding Aroma Hops

When the 45 minute timer ends, I add the aroma hops to the hop spider and set a new timer for 15 minutes.

### Ending the Boil

When the last 15 minute timer ends, I turn off both elements, take off the jacket, turn on my wort chiller, and set the temperature to 65&deg;F. After a while I realize it is taking forever to cool, so I turn on the circulation pump, and that significantly speeds up the cooling process!


## Transferring the Wort to the Fermentor

Once the wort cools, I transfer it to the fermentor using 1/2" tubing attached to the spout on the Brewzilla, shaking it the entire time to aerate.  

## Recording the Original Gravity

Using my fancy refractometer, I record an original gravity of 1.060, which is 0.009 higher than what I need. I decide to leave it as is since I have no more spring water that I can add to bring it down to the target gravity of 0.051.


## Pitching the Yeast and Storing the Fermentor

I add the yeast a little bit at a time, stirring vigorously between additions, until all of the yeast in the package has been emptied in the fermentor. Then I add the lid, stopper and an airlock filled with distilled water, and put the fermentor to bed in my basement. Since I never leave my equipment dirty, I unassemble the Brewzilla, rinsing and scrubbing anything stuck with my scrub daddy. I then fill the Brewzilla with PBW and place all the pieces and tubing within it. Tomorrow I will rinse everything with tap water and start another brew!

If you are looking to start home brewing, check out my [all-grain brew day guide]({{<ref "/guides/1-brew_day.md">}}), where I have compiled all my lessons learned in an easy to read tutorial.

Until next time... Cheers!
