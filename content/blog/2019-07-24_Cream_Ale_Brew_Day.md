Today is brew day, and I will be making the [Brewer's Pantry 'Cream Ale' Kit](http://brewerspantry.com/brewers-pantry-recipe-kits/all-grain-kits/brewers-pantry-cream-ale), which I am very excited about. The last cream ale I made, was from the [Brewer's Best, toasted coconut cream ale, kit]({{<affiliate-links "brewers best toasted coconut">}}). I won't give away the Brewer's Pantry's complete recipe, but I will tell you that there is no lactose sugar involved, which differs greatly from the Brewer's Best's recipe which does include a lot of lactose sugar. I'm going to have to do some research about what defines a cream ale, but I personally do prefer using grains to processed lactose sugar, regardless of the difference in taste.

It is my intention to add coconut extract and a little vanilla extract to this batch, but that will happen on bottling day. For now this is just a straight up cream ale.

I've recently acquired a {{< tooltip "hop spider">}}{{< glossary "hop spider">}}{{< /tooltip >}}, and can't wait to see how much more {{< tooltip "wort">}}{{< glossary "wort">}}{{< /tooltip >}} I can get out of my {{< tooltip "bkettle">}}{{< glossary "brew kettle">}}{{< /tooltip >}} and into my {{< tooltip "fermentor">}}{{< glossary "fermentor">}}{{< /tooltip >}}
 this time. I'm also thinking of ways to use the spent hops after brew day. Perhaps I can make some soap from the spent hops! Do I know how to make soap? Nope, but I'm sure I can figure it out.

# Brew Day Journal

## The Mash

During my last brew, I had issues with preheating my {{< tooltip "mash tun">}}{{< glossary "mash tun">}}{{< /tooltip >}}. This time I have a plan! Before I add the grain to the {{< tooltip "mash tun">}}{{< glossary "mash tun">}}{{< /tooltip >}}, I preheat the {{< tooltip "mash tun">}}{{< glossary "mash tun">}}{{< /tooltip >}} with water from my tea kettle, which I drain into the sink before adding the grain. I'm using my trusty soup pot to heat {{< tooltip "sparge water">}}{{< glossary "sparge water">}}{{< /tooltip >}}, but it takes many rounds with the soup pot till I collect the 6.5 gallons of wort that I need from my {{< tooltip "mash tun">}}{{< glossary "mash tun">}}{{< /tooltip >}}.

## The Boil

This is a simple boil schedule, there will be two additions of hops to the boil, and I cannot wait to see this {{< tooltip "hop spider">}}{{< glossary "hop spider">}}{{< /tooltip >}} in action!

### Adding the Bittering Hops

Once my {{< tooltip "wort">}}{{< glossary "wort">}}{{< /tooltip >}} comes to a gentle boil, I add the {{< tooltip "bittering hops">}}{{< glossary "bittering hops">}}{{< /tooltip >}} and set a timer for 45 minutes. I'm playing close attention to the {{< tooltip "wort">}}{{< glossary "wort">}}{{< /tooltip >}}, as it keeps trying to boil over, and I'm having to remove the lid constantly to settle the {{< tooltip "wort">}}{{< glossary "wort">}}{{< /tooltip >}}.

While I wait for the 45 minutes to finish up, I'm getting the {{< tooltip "wort chiller">}}{{< glossary "wort chiller">}}{{< /tooltip >}} ready by running the hose to the kitchen, and using a spray bottle filled with StarSan mixture to sterilize all of my fermenting equipment.

I run out of things that I can prepare ahead of time, so I start making up [dog biscuit]({{<ref "/guides/2-brew_dog_biscuits.md">}}) dough out of the spent grains. I'll bake them up another day, but for now, I'm just using my mixer and wrapping portions of dough with plastic wrap.

### Adding the Aroma Hops

I add the {{< tooltip "aroma hops">}}{{< glossary "aroma hops">}}{{< /tooltip >}} and {{< tooltip "whirlfloc tablet">}}{{< glossary "whirlfloc tablet">}}{{< /tooltip >}} to the {{< tooltip "hop spider">}}{{< glossary "hop spider">}}{{< /tooltip >}}, and add the {{< tooltip "wort chiller">}}{{< glossary "wort chiller">}}{{< /tooltip >}} to let it sterilize in the last part of the boil. Timer gets set for 15 minutes, and I keep stirring the {{< tooltip "hop spider">}}{{< glossary "hop spider">}}{{< /tooltip >}} only to realize that the whirlfloc tab is not breaking down in the least. Sure enough the instructions state that I need to crush the {{< tooltip "whirlfloc tablet">}}{{< glossary "whirlfloc tablet">}}{{< /tooltip >}}! I will make sure to add a step to my detailed brew day guide.

### Ending the Boil

When the 15 minute timer ends, I remove the {{< tooltip "brew kettle">}}{{< glossary "brew kettle">}}{{< /tooltip >}} from the heat and turn on the {{< tooltip "wort chiller">}}{{< glossary "wort chiller">}}{{< /tooltip >}}. While I wait for the {{< tooltip "wort">}}{{< glossary "wort">}}{{< /tooltip >}} to cool, I am making up more dog biscuit dough. The brew dog is very interested in what I'm doing, but he will have to be patient!

## Transferring the Wort to the Fermentor

When the temperature of the {{< tooltip "wort">}}{{< glossary "wort">}}{{< /tooltip >}} is close to 65&deg;F, I attach my hose to the {{< tooltip "brew kettle">}}{{< glossary "brew kettle">}}{{< /tooltip >}} and get the {{< tooltip "fermentor">}}{{< glossary "fermentor">}}{{< /tooltip >}} in position. When I finally do turn the ball valve on the {{< tooltip "kettle">}}{{< glossary "brew kettle">}}{{< /tooltip >}}, I shake the hose as I fill the {{< tooltip "fermentor">}}{{< glossary "fermentor">}}{{< /tooltip >}} up, to make sure the {{< tooltip "wort">}}{{< glossary "wort">}}{{< /tooltip >}} is oxygenated!

## Recording the Original Gravity

The moment of truth; will I have achieved the {{< tooltip "original gravity">}}{{< glossary "original gravity">}}{{< /tooltip >}} reading that the recipe indicates? In this case, no, I do not. The target {{< tooltip "original gravity">}}{{< glossary "original gravity">}}{{< /tooltip >}} is 1.047, and my hydrometer reads around 1.040. I'm sure there are tricks to raise it, but I can't be bothered for being under by 0.007. For all I know it could be my hydrometer being finicky and sticking to the side of the thief. Either way, I'm moving on.

## Pitching the Yeast and Storing the Fermentor

There is something satisfying about adding the yeast and sealing up the {{< tooltip "fermentor">}}{{< glossary "fermentor">}}{{< /tooltip >}}. I do my usual tiny additions of yeast followed by a stir before adding the next addition of yeast. Doing this reduces the sizes of the clumps of yeast, which will promote a speedy growth of yeast in the first two days. 

Once I got all the yeast in the {{< tooltip "fermentor">}}{{< glossary "fermentor">}}{{< /tooltip >}}, I seal it up with an airlock, and place the {{< tooltip "fermentor">}}{{< glossary "fermentor">}}{{< /tooltip >}} in my cool basement.
