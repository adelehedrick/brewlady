Today is brew day, and I will be cooking the Brewer’s Pantry ‘Pilsner’ kit. This is my first attempt at an all-grain brew, and the only additional equipment that I had to purchase was the lauter tun and some thicker tubing! The jump from extract brewing to all-grain was not as expensive as I thought, and the recipe kits for all-grain are actually cheaper than the extract kits. The wonderful benefit to purchasing from the Brewer’s Pantry, is that they assemble the ingredients at time of order, at which point they will also mill the grain if you wish, at no additional cost. I’m still in shock that I discovered this small business in my old home town that will mill grain, at no additional cost, right when I purchase a kit! The alternative for me, since I am not interested in purchasing a milling machine, is to purchase a recipe kit that has had the grain milled sometime in the past and sitting on a shelf for who knows how long. With all that being said, I would like to mention that I am not being incentivised in any way by Brewer’s Pantry, and am just sharing my very positive experience. Now onto the brew! 

# Equipment
* [Mash/Lauter Tun]({{<affiliate-links "tank_tun">}})
* 1/2 inch clear tubing
* Brew kettle (I use an 8 gal kettle with thermometer and ball valve)
* Giant soup pot (to heat sparge water)
* Hose that fits into the barbed fitting that came with the lauter tun
* Giant spoon
* [Thief]({{<affiliate-links "theif">}})
* [Hydrometer]({{<affiliate-links "hydrometer">}})

# Brew Day Journal
First day with the lauter tun, so I cleaned it out with some PBW and rinsed well. If you are using any new equipment, or the equipment is noticeably dirty, then you should soak it overnight with PBW. Since my gear has been washed with PBW, drip dried and then stored in such a way as to avoid collecting dust, I’m happy to go straight to brewing with most of it.

{{< foldergallery src="img/blog/pilsner_brew_day_july2019/lauter_tun" >}}

The soup pot I intend to use to heat the sparge water was pretty darn dirty, so I used some PBW on that too.

Heated the water to be used in the initial mash in the brew kettle. Used 4.5 gallons (used 2 quart to 1 lb grain which converts to 4.25 gallons of water which I rounded up to 4.5 gallons). Strike water calculation results in 157.8 degrees F.

{{< foldergallery src="img/blog/pilsner_brew_day_july2019/heating_water" >}}

Used heated water to rinse the tun and return back to the kettle to heat the tun a bit before steeping. 

Added grains to the tun, and by the time I checked the kettle, the temp went past 160 degrees F. So much for pre heating the tun!


Next time I’m going to run my tea kettle and add some hot water to the tun to just heat it, and then purge it when it’s time to add grains and water.

In this case I’m going to use the strike temp of 160 degrees, since a simple rule of thumb is to use a strike temp that is 11 degrees higher than your target mash temperature.

Once I have my 4.5 gallons of water mixed in the grains with a good stir of my big giant spoon, I set a timer for 60 minutes. 

{{< foldergallery src="img/blog/pilsner_brew_day_july2019/add_water_to_tun" >}}

I check on the temperature of my sparge water which needs to be at 170 degrees. I’m using a well cleaned (PBW again) Webbers temperature probe since I didn’t want to invest in too much more than the tun on this brew.

When the 60 minute timer alerts me that the mash is done, I drain the liquid into my brew kettle nice and slow. I only get about 3 gallons in my kettle, so I know there will be plenty of sparging to do!

The temperature of my sparge water was a little high, so I added a little bit of room temperature spring water to bring it down to 170 degrees F. At that point I try to gently pour the heated sparge water into the tun to rinse the grains and start heating more sparge water!

I’ll let the sparge water in the tun hang out till the next batch of sparge water heats to 170 degrees F.

Somewhere in the second batch of sparge water, I achieved 5.5 gallons in my kettle. I’ll drain the rest of the water in my tun into the sink, and use the spent grains to make dog biscuits!

Now it’s time to bring my wort to a boil!

For this recipe, once I achieve a boil, I will be adding my bittering hops, allow the wort to boil for 45 minutes, then adding the aroma hops and whirlfloc tablet and boiling for another 15 minutes. When I add the bittering hops, I will also be adding my wort chiller to the kettle to sterilize it in the last 15 minutes of the boil.

While I’m thinking ahead and am waiting for my wort to boil, I’m taking my spray bottle full of StarSan and spraying down the inside of the fermentor and all the pieces. This is a no rinse product, so I drench everything and let everything sit open and in a good draining position.

Before I add the hops and start the timer, I spray down a clean plate with StarSan to use for resting my giant spoon. When I add the hops, I already have the spoon in the kettle, anticipating the wort’s attempt to boil over on me. Once the wort settles back down, I spoon the wort along the edge of the kettle to make sure all of the hops is in the wort, since at the boil over attempt, some of the hops got stuck to the side. Since I have a trusty Google home mini nearby, I call out my instructions to set a timer for 45 minutes while I do this spooning.

I grab my garden hose and run it into my kitchen to get it hooked up to the wort chiller, since I want to have it ready to put in at the end of the 45 minute timer.

{{< foldergallery src="img/blog/pilsner_brew_day_july2019/adding_ingredients_to_boil" >}}

I run some StarSan through the hose that will hook up to the kettle and drain in the fermentor. It is the same hose that I used to drain the wort from the tun into the kettle, but once the wort is made I get sanitizer heavy. Since I’m in sanitization mode, I find the airlock and sanitize it too. While I’m at it, I spray down the wort chiller, even though I intend on it being sanitized by being in the wort for the last 15 minutes of the boil.

When my 45 minute timer ends I add the aroma hops, wort chiller and Whirlfloc tablet, then start a new timer for 15 minutes. I do all this as quickly as possible (while taking pictures).

{{< foldergallery src="img/blog/pilsner_brew_day_july2019/add_wort_chiller" >}}

At the end of the 15 minute timer, I quickly remove the kettle from the heat and onto a hot plate while a helper runs out to turn on the garden hose to run cold water through the wort chiller.

First gravity reading was at 1.050, and the target gravity is 1.045 so I am going to dilute with a little bit of bottled spring water. After adding some spring water, I get an original gravity reading of 1.046 which I am satisfied with.

Sprinkle the yeast a little bit at a time and giving it a good stir between each sprinkle and the fermentor is ready for me to seal up and top with an airlock.

I place the fermentor in my basement where it has an ambient temperature of 15 degrees Celcius. A little warmer than the recommended range in the recipe, but the yeast strain will work. The wort is extremely cloudy and definitely has some hops floating around, so I plan on emptying out the little bulb at the bottom of the fermentor in a couple days.

{{< foldergallery src="img/blog/pilsner_brew_day_july2019/end_boil_add_yeast" >}}

Final volume in the fermentor was just under 4 gallons. I had lost a lot due to evaporation. Next time I’ll collect at least 6.5 gallons of wort from the tun!

Until next brew day... Cheers!
