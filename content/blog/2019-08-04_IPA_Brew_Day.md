Today is brew day and I've made my first post to the accompanying twitter account to live tweet the adventure. Check it out at [&commat;brewladydotcom](https://twitter.com/brewladydotcom). The brew today is another [kit from Brewer's Pantry](http://brewerspantry.com/brewers-pantry-recipe-kits/all-grain-kits/brewers-pantry-ipa), this time an IPA!

There is no new equipment for me to work with today, so I'm confident and believe this brew day won't be as exciting as my brews before (famous last words right there).

# Brew Day Journal

## The Mash

Already I got distracted and the temperature of the initial mash water surpassed my {{< tooltip "strike water temperature">}}{{< glossary "strike water temperature">}}{{< /tooltip >}}! I used that extra wait time to start this post, so we are good.

Once I get the initial {{< tooltip "mash">}}{{< glossary "mash">}}{{< /tooltip >}} going, I set my timer for 60 minutes, then get a thermometer into the {{< tooltip "sparge water">}}{{< glossary "sparge water">}}{{< /tooltip >}} I'm heating in my soup pot. I need to get that {{< tooltip "sparge water">}}{{< glossary "sparge water">}}{{< /tooltip >}} up to 170&deg;F. I always struggle at getting the {{< tooltip "sparge water">}}{{< glossary "sparge water">}}{{< /tooltip >}} to stay at a certain temperature and be at the right temperature when I need it. 

My recipe tells me to collect 6.5 gallons of {{< tooltip "wort">}}{{< glossary "wort">}}{{< /tooltip >}}, but I always end up losing so much volume due to evaporation, so I'm going to round to 7 gallons in hopes I can collect 5 gallons of {{< tooltip "wort">}}{{< glossary "wort">}}{{< /tooltip >}} at the end of the boil.

The 60 minute timer for the initial {{< tooltip "mash">}}{{< glossary "mash">}}{{< /tooltip >}} ends, and I collect the {{< tooltip "wort">}}{{< glossary "wort">}}{{< /tooltip >}}! I try a technique of opening the ball valve on the {{< tooltip "mash tun">}}{{< glossary "mash tun">}}{{< /tooltip >}} the slightest bit, collect the first castings in a separate bowl till it runs free of grain, then add that bowl of castings back into the {{< tooltip "mash tun">}}{{< glossary "mash tun">}}{{< /tooltip >}}. What I am trying to achieve by doing this is to allow the grain to pack into the mesh protecting the valve, and reduce the amount of grain sediment from entering my {{< tooltip "brew kettle">}}{{< glossary "brew kettle">}}{{< /tooltip >}}. 

By the time my initial castings from the {{< tooltip "mash tun">}}{{< glossary "mash tun">}}{{< /tooltip >}} is complete, my {{< tooltip "sparge water">}}{{< glossary "sparge water">}}{{< /tooltip >}} temperature ended up below my target {{< tooltip "sparge water">}}{{< glossary "sparge water">}}{{< /tooltip >}} temperature of 170&deg;F. This is what happens when I am distracted with blogging. From the initial mash I was able to collect 3.5 gallons of wort. I have another 4.5 gallons to collect! I am going to be {{< tooltip "sparging">}}{{< glossary "sparging">}}{{< /tooltip >}} all day at this rate using my soup pot to heat the water! I'm going to have to start considering a new {{< tooltip "kettle">}}{{< glossary "brew kettle">}}{{< /tooltip >}}, and use my current {{< tooltip "kettle">}}{{< glossary "brew kettle">}}{{< /tooltip >}} to heat {{< tooltip "sparge water">}}{{< glossary "sparge water">}}{{< /tooltip >}}. If I'm going to make another large purchase like a new {{< tooltip "kettle">}}{{< glossary "brew kettle">}}{{< /tooltip >}}, I might as well buy a double burner so I can start brewing on my newly refinished back deck. Outdoor home brewing, here I come!

As I wrote that, my {{< tooltip "sparge water">}}{{< glossary "sparge water">}}{{< /tooltip >}} heated well over my target temperature! I end up ladling out hot water into a giant bowl, where I add room temperature water to lower the temperature to the 170&deg;F, before adding it to the mash tun. This actually works to my favor since it allows me to get more volume of {{< tooltip "sparge water">}}{{< glossary "sparge water">}}{{< /tooltip >}} out of my soup pot. 

As I'm {{< tooltip "sparging">}}{{< glossary "sparging">}}{{< /tooltip >}}, I realize my plan of collecting 7 gallons of {{< tooltip "wort">}}{{< glossary "wort">}}{{< /tooltip >}} to boil, might cause some problems. My {{< tooltip "kettle">}}{{< glossary "brew kettle">}}{{< /tooltip >}} is an 8 gallon pot, and the markers max out at 7 gallons. I won't be leaving much room for the boil if I intend on collecting 7 gallons. The other risk, is that if I don't experience enough evaporation, I can end up with a lower {{< tooltip "original gravity">}}{{< glossary "original gravity">}}{{< /tooltip >}} than I am aiming for. This brew is becoming more dramatic as I go. You can tell I live a pretty drama free life if I find brewing dramatic.

After another round of {{< tooltip "sparging">}}{{< glossary "sparging">}}{{< /tooltip >}}, I am so close to 7 gallons of {{< tooltip "wort">}}{{< glossary "wort">}}{{< /tooltip >}} in my {{< tooltip "kettle">}}{{< glossary "brew kettle">}}{{< /tooltip >}}! I start heating a smaller amount of sparge water, so that it heats up faster, and that should help me reach 7 gallons. During the last sparge, I also realize another issue: this {{< tooltip "kettle">}}{{< glossary "brew kettle">}}{{< /tooltip >}} is going to be too heavy for me to lift onto the stove. I will have to call a helper to help me lift this heavy {{< tooltip "kettle">}}{{< glossary "brew kettle">}}{{< /tooltip >}}.

## The Boil

I was able to get the {{< tooltip "kettle">}}{{< glossary "brew kettle">}}{{< /tooltip >}} onto the stove myself. I did this by first lifting the {{< tooltip "kettle">}}{{< glossary "brew kettle">}}{{< /tooltip >}} onto a chair, and then after taking a breath, I lifted it onto the stove. My muscles are now bulging and I'm ready to direct people to the beach if they need directions.

I add the {{< tooltip "hop spider">}}{{< glossary "hop spider">}}{{< /tooltip >}} to the {{< tooltip "kettle">}}{{< glossary "brew kettle">}}{{< /tooltip >}} right away, so it can heat up with the rest of the {{< tooltip "wort">}}{{< glossary "wort">}}{{< /tooltip >}}.

I'm looking ahead in my brew schedule, and I have three hop additions that I will need to execute, followed by a {{< tooltip "dry hopping">}}{{< glossary "dry hopping">}}{{< /tooltip >}} addition that will happen after the {{< tooltip "primary fermentation">}}{{< glossary "primary fermentation">}}{{< /tooltip >}}. I guess this will end up being my first batch of beer where I will be doing a {{< tooltip "secondary fermentation">}}{{< glossary "secondary fermentation">}}{{< /tooltip >}}. Since I am using a [FastFerment]({{<affiliate-links "fastferment">}}) for this batch, the {{< tooltip "primary">}}{{< glossary "primary fermentation">}}{{< /tooltip >}} and {{< tooltip "secondary fermentation">}}{{< glossary "secondary fermentation">}}{{< /tooltip >}} will take place in the same vessel, only I will empty out the little bulb at the bottom between fermentation periods.

Anyway, back to the boil, the very exciting part where I wait for a pot to boil. I'm being literal here. I have 7 gallons of {{< tooltip "wort">}}{{< glossary "wort">}}{{< /tooltip >}} in an 8 gallon pot. This has the potential to end in disaster.

### Adding the Bittering Hops

Upon inspection of the hops that I have in my kit, it looks like I was given Saaz hops instead of the Northern Brewer hops that the recipe indicates. Perhaps they are the same thing. Either way, I add them as my {{< tooltip "bittering hops">}}{{< glossary "bittering hops">}}{{< /tooltip >}} and start a timer for 40 minutes.

After writing out that above paragraph, I hear the terrifying sound of liquid hitting the stove top, a sizzle indicating boil over. I never ran so fast in my life and I'm happy that I grabbed an oven mitt to take the lid off. To avoid any further boil over, I'm just going to have to leave the lid off and allow for even more evaporation to occur. I can't be watching this pot boil because I need to run out and get the hose for the {{< tooltip "wort chiller">}}{{< glossary "wort chiller">}}{{< /tooltip >}}, and put away clean dishes. Life has to go on! With that being said, I want to enjoy the remainder of the weekend, so I don't intend to bake up the spent grains into dog biscuits. I still have a large supply from the last brew day.

### Adding Flavor Hops

When adding the flavor hops, I also add the {{< tooltip "wort chiller">}}{{< glossary "wort chiller">}}{{< /tooltip >}} to give it time to get sanitized from the heat. This addition goes without a hitch, and with the hop spider getting filled up, I constantly stir it to ensure as much of the flavor as possible is getting added to the {{< tooltip "wort">}}{{< glossary "wort">}}{{< /tooltip >}}. This time set the timer for 15 minutes, so I don't leave the kitchen.

### Adding Aroma Hops and Whirlfloc

The {{< tooltip "aroma hops">}}{{< glossary "aroma hops">}}{{< /tooltip >}} in this recipe contains two different hops, and 3 oz in total. Adding 3 oz of hops to the {{< tooltip "spider">}}{{< glossary "hop spider">}}{{< /tooltip >}} made the liquid inside very thick, and with the crushed {{< tooltip "whirlfloc tablet">}}{{< glossary "whirlfloc tablet">}}{{< /tooltip >}} also in the {{< tooltip "hop spider">}}{{< glossary "hop spider">}}{{< /tooltip >}}, I'm destined for 5 minutes of constant stirring. 

### Ending the Boil

The last timer of the boil rings, and I quickly remove the {{< tooltip "kettle">}}{{< glossary "brew kettle">}}{{< /tooltip >}} from the heat, and call for a helper to turn on the garden hose which I have hooked up to the {{< tooltip "wort chiller">}}{{< glossary "wort chiller">}}{{< /tooltip >}}. This is such a satisfying wait. The hard work and sensitive timing of the boil is over, and now I can leisurely monitor the {{< tooltip "kettle">}}{{< glossary "brew kettle">}}{{< /tooltip >}}'s temperature while I assemble the StarSan sanitized {{< tooltip "fermentor">}}{{< glossary "fermentor">}}{{< /tooltip >}} pieces.

## Transferring the Wort to the Fermentor

Once the {{< tooltip "wort">}}{{< glossary "wort">}}{{< /tooltip >}} has cooled to 65&deg;F, it is time to transfer the {{< tooltip "wort">}}{{< glossary "wort">}}{{< /tooltip >}} to the {{< tooltip "fermentor">}}{{< glossary "fermentor">}}{{< /tooltip >}}. I have my hose hooked up to the {{< tooltip "kettle">}}{{< glossary "brew kettle">}}{{< /tooltip >}} by this point, and the transfer is a matter of me turning the ball valve and violently shaking the hose to oxygenate the wort as it enters the {{< tooltip "fermentor">}}{{< glossary "fermentor">}}{{< /tooltip >}}. This is very important since this is the only oxygen that this {{< tooltip "wort">}}{{< glossary "wort">}}{{< /tooltip >}} will receive for the yeast to utilize. 

## Recording the Original Gravity

Well on this brew, I collected 7 gallons from the {{< tooltip "mash tun">}}{{< glossary "mash tun">}}{{< /tooltip >}}, lets see if that drastically effects the gravity reading. The target {{< tooltip "original gravity">}}{{< glossary "original gravity">}}{{< /tooltip >}} for this recipe is 1.047, and I came close enough with 1.040. 

## Pitching the Yeast and Storing the Fermentor

Not sure why the process of adding yeast to the wort is called "pitching the yeast", but it is. Maybe I'll look that up later. Why couldn't they just call it what it is? Either way, I add the yeast a little bit at a time, and use my stir to stir it in good before adding more. Once my little package is empty, I seal up the {{< tooltip "fermentor">}}{{< glossary "fermentor">}}{{< /tooltip >}}, add the airlock filled with water, and put this baby to bed in my dark, cool, basement.
