Today is brew day and an exciting one at that! Today will be a Brewer's Pantry kit, their American Rye, but even more exciting than that, this will be my first day with the RoboBrew Brewzilla v3.1! I woke up this morning dreading an entire day of slaving over the stove and watching temperatures rise, which meant that I was coming out of the honeymoon stage of being a new home brewer. My solution was to up my game with the Brewzilla!

# Brew Day Journal

## The Mash

This time around, I decided to lower my water to grain ratio to 1.5 quarts of water to pound of grain. This resulted with an initial mash volume of 15 liters (I keep changing units). I want to mash at 150&deg;F, so my initial mash temp turns out to be 160&deg;F (I'm using a calculator on the [BeerSmith 3](http://beersmith.com) app).

Once my initial mash water heats to 160&deg;F, I turn off the 1000 W element, and I add all the grain in the recipe, stirring between additions, and eventually I turn the circulation pump on to help wet the grain. Once I have all the grain added, and I am confident that all the grain is wet, I add the top to the mash pipe and add the overflow top, and start a timer for the 60 minute mash.

On my stove I start heating 6 gallons of sparge water, which is more than I would need, however I know I will lose water due to the spout not being right at the bottom.

When the timer ends, I raise the mash pipe above the kettle and let it drain. I set the desired temperature to 90&deg;C, which I know is less than the boiling point of water, because I am wanting to start to heat up the wort as I sparge.

Once I achieve 6.5 gallons of wort in my kettle I move the mash pipe into my sink, and move on to the boil.


## The Boil

I set the temperature to 101&deg;C, and turn on the 1000 W element. As the temperature hit the boiling point, I wasn't paying attention because I was making dog biscuit dough out of the spent grains, so I missed the hot break and found a mess around the top of the kettle.

### Adding the Bittering Hops

Once I stirred in the left over proteins back into the wort, I add the wort chiller, hop spider, and the hops into the hop spider. I have a long skinny spoon that I use to stir the hops down into the wort. I set the timer for 45 minutes and hang out for a bit.


### Adding Aroma Hops

When the 45 minute timer ends, I add the aroma hops to the hop spider and set a new timer for 15 minutes.

### Ending the Boil

When the last 15 minute timer ends, I turn off both elements, take off the jacket, turn on my wort chiller, and set the temperature to 65&deg;F. After a while I realize it is taking forever to cool, so I turn on the circulation pump, and that significantly speeds up the cooling process!


## Transferring the Wort to the Fermentor

Once the wort cools, I transfer it to the fermentor using 1/2" tubing attached to the spout on the Brewzilla, shaking it the entire time to aerate.  

## Recording the Original Gravity

Using my fancy refractometer, I record an original gravity of 1.060, which is 0.009 higher than what I need. I decide to leave it as is since I have no more spring water that I can add to bring it down to the target gravity of 0.051.


## Pitching the Yeast and Storing the Fermentor

I add the yeast a little bit at a time, stirring vigorously between additions, until all of the yeast in the package has been emptied in the fermentor. Then I add the lid, stopper and an airlock filled with distilled water, and put the fermentor to bed in my basement. Since I never leave my equipment dirty, I unassemble the Brewzilla, rinsing and scrubbing anything stuck with my scrub daddy. I then fill the Brewzilla with PBW and place all the pieces and tubing within it. Tomorrow I will rinse everything with tap water and start another brew!

Until next time... Cheers!
