About pages are hard to write, so I will keep this simple. During work hours, I am a Data Scientist at the most vibrant company near Toronto. Outside of work hours, I am a mother of two sweet young boys, wife to a husband that humors my adventures, and explorer of many interests. 

I am a novice home brewer, but with my background in teaching, I aim to fill the gap in beginner guides to home brewing. My intention with this blog is to share my experience and hopefully inspire new brewers to take the plunge on their first (and second) brew.
