<!-- Glossary of terms in alphabetical order-->


<!-- A -->
{{ if (eq (.Get 0) "all-grain brewing") }}
Brewing using grains as the main ingredient, rather than extract.
{{ end }}

{{ if (eq (.Get 0) "aroma hops") }}
These are added near the end of the boil, and typically are only boiled or 15 minutes or less.
{{ end }}

<!-- B -->
{{ if (eq (.Get 0) "bittering hops") }}
These hops have higher acidity and are added to the wort near the beginning of the boil.
{{ end }}

{{ if (eq (.Get 0) "brew kettle") }}
Large pot for boiling the wort. Typically these have a ball-valve for easy transferring of the wort and a thermometer for monitoring temperature.
{{ end }}
<!-- C -->
<!-- D -->
<!-- E -->

{{ if (eq (.Get 0) "extract brewing") }}
Brewing using malt extract syrup
{{ end }}

<!-- F -->
{{ if or (eq (.Get 0) "fermentation") (eq (.Get 0) "ferment")}}
The process where yeast consumes the sugars in the wort and produces alcohol.
{{ end }}

{{ if (eq (.Get 0) "fermentor") }}
Large container used to store the cooled wort with the yeast for the fermentation period. Typically sealed tight with an airlock attached. 
{{ end }}

{{ if (eq (.Get 0) "final gravity") }}
The final gravity (FG) is your last hydrometer reading after fermentation has completed and you are ready to bottle or keg your beer.
{{ end }}
<!-- G -->
<!-- H -->
<!-- I -->
<!-- J -->
<!-- K -->
<!-- L -->
<!-- M -->
{{ if or (eq (.Get 0) "mash") (eq (.Get 0) "mashing") }}
(n.) Milled grains and hot water. This becomes the wort. (v.) Mixing milled grain with hot water and letting the mixture to steep for a duration of time to extract the fermentable sugars. 
{{ end }}

{{ if (eq (.Get 0) "mash tun") }}
Large insulated container used for steeping grains in hot water (see mash).
{{ end }}
<!-- N -->
<!-- O -->
{{ if (eq (.Get 0) "original gravity") }}
The original gravity (OG) is the last hydrometer reading before putting the wort into the fermentor.
{{ end }}
<!-- P -->
<!-- Q -->
<!-- R -->
<!-- S -->
{{ if or (eq (.Get 0) "sparge") (eq (.Get 0) "sparging") }}
The process of spraying the spent grains with hot water to extract additional sugars from the husks. This happens after the initial draining of water from the mash.
{{ end }}

{{ if (eq (.Get 0) "sparge water") }}
Water used to spray the spent grains to extract additional sugars from the husks.
{{ end }}

{{ if (eq (.Get 0) "spent grains") }}
The grains left over after the mash. These can make great dog biscuits!
{{ end }}

{{ if (eq (.Get 0) "strike water temperature") }}
This is the temperature of the water before being added to the grain for the initial mash (steeping of the grain). Typically this is around 11&deg;F higher than your target mash temperature.
{{ end }}
<!-- T -->
{{ if (eq (.Get 0) "target gravity") }}
The target gravity is the hydrometer reading you are aiming to achieve.
{{ end }}

{{ if (eq (.Get 0) "target mash temperature") }}
The ideal temperature of the grain and hot water mixture during the mash.
{{ end }}
<!-- U -->
<!-- V -->
<!-- W -->
{{ if (eq (.Get 0) "whirlfloc tablet") }}
Contains Iris Moss and purified carrageenan that assists in the coagulation and settling of haze-producing proteins and beta glucans.
{{ end }}

{{ if (eq (.Get 0) "wort") }}
The resulting solution of boiling the sugary liquid from the mash with hops.
{{ end }}

{{ if (eq (.Get 0) "wort chiller") }}
A copper coil that you run cold tap water (usually from your garden hose) through to end the boil and speed up the cooling process.
