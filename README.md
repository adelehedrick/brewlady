### Making a bunch of thumbnails

To generate a bunch of thumbnails in a folder, after you install `imagemagick`, you can use the command in the folder containing the images:
```
for i in `find . -type f ! -name "*-thumb.jpg" -name "*.jpg"`; do echo $i; if [ -f ${i%.*}-thumb.jpg ]; then continue; fi; convert $i -thumbnail 250x250 ${i%.*}-thumb.jpg; done
```

To remove the generated thumbnails use:
```
rm *-thumb.jpg
```


### Troubleshooting the make upload command

If your upload command is not working, it is likely because you need to accept the ssl key.
