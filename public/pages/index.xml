      <description>Affiliate Links When I mention equipment or products that I use on this website, I use Amazon affiliate links to earn a commission on any sales that take place from the link being used. Links to products that aren&amp;rsquo;t on the Amazon domain are not commissioned, and I include these to make sure anyone can recreate the processes that I describe.
Advertisements Advertisements are a means for me to generate revenue from this website and I cannot speak to the quality of the products being advertised.</description>
